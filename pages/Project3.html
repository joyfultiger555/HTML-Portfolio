    <div class="personas-body">For this project we chose an existing start up company, and without looking at the company 
        itself worked through sketches, as well as hi-fi and low-fi prototypes in order to represent our idea for the company's 
        description. The project was done in groups and each group was required to present in front of a larger group. This allowed 
        each group to receive feedback on aspects such as usability, color schemes, learnability and memorability, etc.
